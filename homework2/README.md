Homework 2
========

Assignment Files : Point.java, LineSegment.java, Rectangle.java, RightTriangle.java, Circle.java, Square.java
J-Unit Test Files: PointTest.java, LineSegmentTest.java, RectangleTest.java, RightTriangleTest.java, CircleTest.java, SquareTest.java

For this homework, I created seperate files for each different component with a corresponding J-unit test file. In each component file I have various "getters," which return needed values such as the x and y coordinates to perform operations in other classes. Along with this, I have created certain methods that make required operations easier, such as the the distance from point to point. In general, each shape consists of a reference point and its respective dimensions. This allowed me to easily perform opterations such as transalte and find the bounding rectangle. Each method I created was tested in the class's respective J-unit file in order to demenostrate that it performed the opertaion correctly. 

There is no object oriented structure implemented and as a result, there are many lines of duplicated code from class to class.
